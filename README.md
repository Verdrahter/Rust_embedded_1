# Rust_embedded_1

This should become a collection of samples for the Tiva launchpad with the TM4C1294 microcontroller. The goal is to practise Rust. The development is done under Linux.

<debugging_tiva_tm4c1294> is a setup for openocd. openocd controls the ICDI (interface for on-chip debugging). The GNU debugger can access it as a remote target.

<minimal_project> ist a little project to test debugging using the GNU debugger using ICDI (interface for on-chip debugging) of the Tiva launchpad. For debugging openocd (refer to project <debugging_tiva_tm4c1294>) and the GNU debugger can be used.
